## 📄 What is **IPNI**?

**IPNI** provides nomenclatural data (spelling, author, types and first place/date of publication) for the scientific names of vascular plants from family to infraspecific ranks.

The nomenclatural data and name registration provided by IPNI is produced by a collaboration between `The Royal Botanic Gardens Kew`, `The Harvard University Herbaria` and `The Australian National Herbarium` hosted by **The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew**.

## ✨ Why Was IPNI Created?

1. **Standardization**:
   - To ensure consistency in plant nomenclature worldwide.

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Provide a centralized and easily accessible source of plant name information.

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Support botanists, researchers, and taxonomists by offering a unified platform for data sharing.

4. **Historical Preservation**:
   - Document the history and changes in plant nomenclature over time.
